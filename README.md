This app automatically create a deck of cards with English words with definition and examples using Cambridge Dictionary.
You can use created deck or move to another deck if you want. But you should click all the words firstly in the first deck.

The app is easily modified so you can make your own parser for another dictionary and use it instead, or use several ones.

The app extract only the first definition of the word, but it only depends on parser though.

I'm considering also adding some Japanese dictionary parser. 
Python must be installed on your computer to run it.
