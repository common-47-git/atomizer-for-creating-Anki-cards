# Anki Automizer

This application automatically creates a deck of Anki cards with English words, including definitions and examples from the Cambridge Dictionary. You can use the created deck directly or move all the cards to another deck if desired. Note that you should click all the words in the initial deck first.

The app is designed to be easily modified, allowing you to create your own parser for another dictionary or use multiple dictionaries. Currently, it extracts only the first definition of each word, but this behavior can be adjusted by modifying the parser.

Future plans include adding a parser for a Japanese dictionary. Please note that Python and all necessary libraries must be installed on your computer to run this application. The project is primarily intended for personal use, so some of the aforementioned issues have not been prioritized.
